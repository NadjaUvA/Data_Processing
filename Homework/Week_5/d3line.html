			<p class="information">The unemployment rate is given as a percentage of the labour force. Unemployed people are defined as available and looking for work. As soon as someone stops looking, this person is not noted as unemployed anymore. The unemployed 15 to 24 year-olds are covered by the youth unemployment rate.</p>
